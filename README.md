============================================================ INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ASSIGNMENT
PROJECT TITLE
Python-Based Information Retrieval System

OBJECTIVE
To build a simple, clean, and educational Information Retrieval system in Python. The system calculates Term Frequency (TF), Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), TF-IDF, and Cosine Similarity to search and rank 10 text-only documents against a user query. All calculations are implemented manually without advanced machine learning libraries (such as scikit-learn).

DATASET DESCRIPTION
Exactly 10 text documents are located in the 'datasets/' directory. Each file contains educational/reference material (approx. 300-500 words) covering the following topics:

Artificial Intelligence
Machine Learning
Deep Learning
Natural Language Processing
Computer Networks
Cybersecurity
Cloud Computing
Database Management Systems
Data Science
Software Engineering
The texts have natural overlapping vocabulary representing actual student essays.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Programming Language: Python 3
Libraries: os, math, re, csv, collections (all built-in standard libraries)
FORMULAS USED
Term Frequency (TF): TF(t, d) = (Number of occurrences of term t in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)

Document Frequency (DF): DF(t) = Number of documents containing term t

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): IDF(t) = log(N / DF(t)) where N = 10 (total number of documents)

TF-IDF: TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t)

Cosine Similarity: Cosine(A, B) = (A . B) / (|A| * |B|) where: A . B = dot product of vector A and vector B |A| = magnitude of vector A |B| = magnitude of vector B

Range: Range = Maximum Similarity - Minimum Similarity

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command: python information_retrieval.py

Enter a search query when prompted (e.g. "machine learning").

The ranked results, similarity scores, range, and step-by-step samples will be displayed.

The detailed tables and metrics will be saved in the 'outputs/' folder as CSV and TXT files.

EXAMPLE QUERY

Query: machine learning algorithms
